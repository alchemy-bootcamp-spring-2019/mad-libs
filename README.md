# Create Your Own Mad Libs Generator

Mad libs have a hidden section of text (a paragraph or two), in which certain adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs are ready to be switched out for user provided input.

## Requirements

* As always, drive with tests
* Style as you like
* Commit regularly (at least every pomodoro). Projects without commits showing your work step by step will not pass.
